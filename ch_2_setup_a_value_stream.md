# Setup a Development Value Stream

The instructions below outline a step-by-step method for defining your work using a Value Stream Map. Processes are ultimately defined by the flow of materials and information across your team's organization. It helps us learn-to-see how our work is performed and what obstacles inhibit our performance. Informatics specialists, programmers, human factors engineers, coding specialists, data scientists, technical writers are who typically works in a development value stream and are responsible for its performance. Do not confuse a value stream with a workflow or other process diagram.  While a Value Stream does have steps like a process, it is meant to span end-to-end and across functions to help participants see contributions by them and others and provide clarity for improvement activities. Below are some other benefits of mapping your Value Stream.

- **Enhances Systems Thinking**. System thinking is looking at a complex activity and breaking it down into components and highlighting the relationships between those components. For various reasons, people often hold mental models in their heads that represent their understanding of the complex system but rarely are two mental models alike. Value stream mapping provides a holistic view of various activities the team must perform and the relationships with each other needed to produce a product.
- **Visual Unification Tool**. A Value Stream map is a graphical illustration of a system, created by a teammates across functions. It helps participants to see and understand the end-to-end process. Value Stream Maps help to combine each participants individual mental model of the system into a unified view.
- **Simplification Tool.** Often relationships between activities across several functions and their commumications via information systems are very complex. Value Stream Maps provide a means to distill complexity into its essential elements and measurements.
- **Practical Means to Drive Continuous Improvement**. As stated earlier, the Value Stream Map is a strategic tool, used by teams to understand where obstacles to their performance may exsist and to prioritize improvement activities. The Value Stream Map is a constantly evolving document that reflects the results of improvement activities.  During Program Increment Planning, improvement activities are prioritized along with customer related tasks.

## Step 1 - Develop a Value Stream Canvas

This section describes how the team will describe the value stream and how it is measured. A value stream can be expressed in layers, with the physical steps outlined and the supporting technical layer shown. We describe our objective value stream using a Development Value Stream Canvas. A file with a Development Value Stream canvas is available
