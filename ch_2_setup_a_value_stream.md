# Setup a Development Value Stream

The instructions below outline a step-by-step method for defining your work using a Value Stream Map. Processes are ultimately defined by the flow of materials and information across your team's organization. It helps us learn-to-see how our work is performed and what obstacles inhibit our performance. Informatics specialists, programmers, human factors engineers, coding specialists, data scientists, technical writers are who typically works in a development value stream and are responsible for its performance. Do not confuse a value stream with a workflow or other process diagram.  While a Value Stream does have steps like a process, it is meant to span across functions and provide clarity for improvement activities. Below are some other benefits of mapping your Value Stream.

- **Visual Unification Tool**. They are meant to be created by a team of stakeholders from across functions. It helps participants to see and understand the process end-to-end. Value Stream Maps help to combine each participants individual mental model of the system into a unified view.
- **Enhance Systems Thinking** by providing a holistic view of the various activities the team must perform to produce a product. 
- **Simplification Tool.** Often relationships between activities across several functions and their commumications via information systems is very complex. Value Stream Maps provide a means to distill complexity into its essential elements and measurements.
- **Practical Means to Drive Continuous Improvement**. As stated earlier, the Value Stream Map is a strategic tool, used by teams to understand where obstacles to their performance may exsist and to prioritize improvement activities. The Value Stream Map is a constantly evolving document that reflects the results of improvement activities.  During Program Increment Planning, improvement activities are prioritized along with customer related tasks.

## Step 1 - Develop a Value Stream Canvas

This section describes how the team will describe the value stream and how it is measured. A value stream can be expressed in layers, with the physical steps outlined and the supporting technical layer shown. We describe our objective value stream using a Development Value Stream Canvas. A file with a Development Value Stream canvas is available
