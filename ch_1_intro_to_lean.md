# Introduction to Lean at CIDMO

Lean is a theory and a work method that is aimed at maximizing value-added activities. Value-added activities are those activities that increase the incremental value of your product in the eyes of your customer. Certainly, a product can be a physical item, a block of code, a writing or even the result of a service. **Implementing Lean will be a transformation of how CIDMO prioritizes and performs work.** When overlaid with Agile work-methods, Lean promotes transparency, improves delivery speed, improves product quality and increases focus on priorities. Indeed, Lean succeeds because it allows people time and space to plan, innovate and challenge the status quo. Lean provides an engagement process that gathers the tacit knowledge frontline workers have and formalizes that knowledge to improve processes necessary to support the strategic direction of CIDMO.

## Lean Is Based on 5 Principles

### 1. Define Value

In CIDMO, **Value** is defined as activities which result in a benefit, divided by the cost of deriving the benfit. So value can be increased by improving the benefit, by reducing the cost of deriving the benefit, or both.

### 2. Map the Value Stream

Mapping the value stream is a unified effort to distill the macro process steps of delivering value to the patient. It helps leaders to understand cross-functional dependencies across functional silos, to see the affect of information technology enablers, and create improvement targets and implementation strategies. **Value Streams** differ from workflows or other process maps, because they focus on macro process steps, information flows and their associated measurements, vice getting into the weeds of more tactical process steps. The definition of **Value Streams** in Agile methods are expanded to include "Development Value Streams," which are standing service lines that enable improvements in an "Operational or Clinical" **Value Stream.**

### 3. Create Flow

In an ideal state, work in a value stream should flow uninterrupted. Usually, some form of waste obstructs the movement of value through the system. Examples of waste are listed in number 5 below. When a system is optimized to flow, unobstructed by wasteful obstacles, work if performed more quickly, with less frustration and with higher efficiency and quality.

### 4. Establish Pull

Work on one thing at a time in order of priority. Many organizations divide people's time among several priorities. Working this way makes it difficult to develop team dynamics, such as habitual working relationships, continuity, a full understanding of dependencies across functions and a task focus that is necessary for the team to successfullly work through complex issues. Moreover, coordinating work among different skill sets leads to some people working ahead and others having nothing to do. In an effort to not let workers idle, managers assign work to fill the "void" using employees who appear to have capacity. However, the employee really doesn't have excess capacity, because they are waiting for someone to give them upstream information or product. When the product or information actually arrives, they cannot work on it because they are distracted with the earlier "void" assignment. This leads to confusion, quality problems and delays.

### 5. Relentlessly pursue Perfection through the Removal of Waste

Pursuing perfection and removing waste is a key driver to the innovation process. Learning to see **and not accept** waste in all of its forms is fundamental to improving processes. Often workers see waste but ignore it because they don't feel empowered to do anything about it. Many workers develop methods that are responsive to a wasteful activity called a "workaround," which ironically is a form of innovation. However, because the "workaround" is not pulled into mainstream or formal knowledge, it can often be frowned upon and viewed as non-compliant behavior. Lean provides the means and methods to capture this frontline tacit knowledge and convert it into mainstream formal knowledge for all to benefit.

|Type of Waste | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
|**Transport**| Moving products that are not actually required to perform the processing|
|**Inventory**| all components, work in progress and the finished product not being processed|
|**Motion**| people or equipment moving or walking more than is required to perform the processing|
|**Waiting**|waiting for the next production step|
|**Overproduction**| production ahead of demand|
|**Over Processing**| resulting from poor tool or product design creating unnecessary activity|
|**Defects**|the effort involved in inspecting for and fixing defects|

## Value 

**Value** is the benefit we deliver divided by its cost. Value is rarely delivered by a single person with a single action. Typically value is delivered with a series of activities conducted by multiple people with different competencies. When these activities are strung together as a sequence of events and coupled with detailed descriptions and measurements, it is called a **Value Stream**.  A value-stream offers a wholistic view of how work flows through the entire system. It differs from a workflow, because it is at the macro level, is quantitative and supports strategic decision-making. Moreover, value-streams cut across functional silos - forcing the organization to think about value delivery in terms of fulfilling customer expectations.

## Value Flows to The Clinical Value Stream

The Veterans Health Administration operates multiple **Clinical Value Streams** (CVS) to deliver medical services to Veterans. For example, when a Veteran calls an appointment scheduler and makes an appointment, that would be considered a value-added activity. However, when the Vet comes for his visit and spends 30 minutes in a waiting room - this is non-value added activity. This is an example of how some obstacle has prevented the Veteran from moving from the doorway, straight into the doctors examination room. Some obstacles are pure waste, such as a capacity imbalance on the clinical staff or unavoidable waste, such as a policy which directs the Veteran fill out a form before starting care. Value can also take the form of quality and safety. For example, if a Veteran has an allergy, but the clinical decision support system does not catch the information and provide a reminder dialogue, it may result in a poor patient outcome or put the patient at risk. The key to delivering value is to have a direct affect on these processes in a manner that enhances patient flow, by removing waste.

Most value-streams are characterized graphically with respective rate and quality measurements, supporting information systems, quantities of people required with their desired competencies, and triggers or signals that start and stop parts of the process to move items along.  An example of a CVS is illustrated below.  _Please note that most CVS are not currently documented._ The goal of lean is to reduce waste in this system and improve the quality of value-added actitivities; therefore, **any value we create must flow to this system to be actualized.**

## CIDMO Operates Development Value Streams

CIDMO has many portfolios that describe competencies they can use to fulfill customer requirements. Using Lean principles, we are organizing these competencies around **Development Value Streams (DVS)**. As features for customers are developed from the DVS, _it flows to improvements in the CVS_; thus, value we create is being actualized in terms of performance improvement in the CVS.

## Agile Release Trains (ART)

An Agile Release Train is a standing "team of teams" that groups two or more Development Value Streams around a common mission or customer. Detailed information can be found at the [SAFe Agile Release Train](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/agile-release-train/). Collectively, the Integrated Clinical Communities and the Program Offices participate in the Integrated Clinical Practice Management Board to accept new work and prioritize the work backlog for the ART. The ART is managed by specific roles that have resource authority and are responsible for integrating backlog work into existing product portfolios.

- **Release Train Engineer (RTE):** is responsible for managing the relationship with business and product managers and clears obstacles that impede Agile Team's progress.
- **Business Owners:** are the CIDMO directors (i.e., Office of Primary Care, Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, and others) who are responsible for resourcing teams to complete backlog tasks.
- **Program Managers:** are the program office representatives who are responsible for defining how work in the backlog integrates with product portfolios managed by their offices.
  
 ### Agile Teams
  
Agile Teams are the cornerstone of the Agile Release Train (ART).  Agile Teams are typically cross-functionally organized with specialized role to fulfill the mission, with two positions that have specific team operations management roles.
  
- **Scrum Master:**  is similar to a traditional project manager. A Scrum Master has expert knowledge of how work is tracked using the Kanban method and helps the team to understand its performance. This assists the team during planning, because the team understands its capacity; therefore, plans its committments during planning more precisely. The Scrum Master is also a team advocate who helps to clear obstacles, by coordinating needed resources or escalate team needs via the "Scrum of Scrum" meeting conducted by the Release Train Engineer.
- **Product Owner:** is the individual that ensures that the outputs from the team meet the requirements of the use-case or design intent in terms of fit, form and function. The Product Owner maintains a standing relationships with Program Managers to understand and help integrate new features into existing portfolios.

### How It All Fits Together
  
Every month, representatives fro the Integrated Clinical Communities (ICC) and the Program Offices (OPC, OMHSP and others) participate with CIDMO in the Integrated Health Practices Management Board (IHPMB).  During the meeting, feature intake requests are reviewed by members of the board and are voted on for acceptance into the work backlog. Then members evaluate the features and prioritize the work in the queue for the Agile Teams in the ART to develop.

Once per quarter, a Program Increment Planning Conference (PIPC) is convened over a 1 to 5 day period.  The length of the PIPC is dependent on the volumn of work to be planned and the number of Agile Teams involved. During the conference, Agile teams review work in the program backlogs and break the work down into two week sprints. The result of each sprint, barring any obstacles, should result in an incremental product. The Agile Teams sequence the work and determine how far into the backlog they can complete. If there are features desired by Product Owners that the Agile Team may not be able to deliver to meet expectations, resource and time requirements can be negotiated with managers present to overcome or at least understand constraints that would affect on-time delivery.
