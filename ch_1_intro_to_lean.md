# Introduction to Lean

Lean is a theory and a work method that is aimed at maximizing value-added activities. Value-added activities are those activities that increase the incremental value of your product in the eyes of your customer. Certainly, a product can be a physical item, a block of code, a writing or even a service. Implementing Lean will be a transformation of how CIDMO prioritizes and performs work. When overlaid with Agile methods, Lean promotes transparency, improves delivery speed, improves product quality and increases focus on priorities. Indeed, Lean succeeds because it allows people time and space to plan, innovate and challenge the status quo.

## Lean Is Based on 4 Principles

- Define **Value**. (graphic)
- Map the Value Stream. (graphic)
- Create **Flow** - so steps defined in the value stream flow uninterrupted. (Graphic)
- Establish **Pull** - work on one thing at a time in order of priority (Kanban). (Graphic)
- Relentlessly pursue the absolute **Removal of Waste**. (Graphic)

## Value 

**Value** is the benefit we deliver divided by its cost. Value is rarely delivered by a single person with a single action. Typically value is delivered with a series of activities conducted by multiple people with different competencies. When these activities are strung together as a sequence of events and coupled with detailed descriptions and measurements, it is called a **Value Stream**.

## Value Flows to The Clinical Value Stream

The Veterans Health Administration operates multiple **Clinical Value Streams** (CVS) to deliver medical services to Veterans. A value-stream is a series of process steps that increase the value of a given product of service in the eyes of the customer. For example, when a Vet calls an appointment scheduler and makes an appointment, that would be considered a value-added activity. However, when the Vet comes for his visit and spends 30 minutes in a waiting room - this is non-value added activity.

Most value-streams are characterized graphically with respective rate and quality measurements, supporting technical systems, people required and their desired competencies, and triggers or signals that move items along in the process.  An example of a CVS is illustrated below.  _Please note that most CVS are not currently documented._ The goal of lean is to reduce waste in this system and improve the quality of value-added actitivities; therefore, any value we create must flow to this system to be actualized.

## CIDMO Operates Development Value Streams

CIDMO has many portfolios that describe competencies they can fulfill with customers. Using the Lean method, we are organizing these competencies around **Development Value Streams (DVS)**. As features for customers are developed from the DVS, _it flows to improvements in the CVS_; thus, value we create is being actualized in terms of performance improvement in the CVS.
