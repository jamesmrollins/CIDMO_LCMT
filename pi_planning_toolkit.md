# PI Planning is Essential to Lean-Agile

> "Program Increment (PI) Planning is a cadence-based, face-to-face event that serves as the heartbeat of the Agile Release Train (ART), aligning all the teams on the ART to a shared mission and Vision. PI planning is essential to SAFe: **"If you are not doing it, you are not doing SAFe."** © Scaled Agile, Inc.

## Introduction

**Plans are nothing; planning is everything.** *- Dwight D. Eisenhower*

Divisions within CIDMO will partner with business owners and stakeholders from multiple VHA offices to conduct Program Increment (PI) Planning events that enable communication, visibility, and collaboration across Agile teams in the prioritization and planning of backlog activities. PI Planning is a Scaled Agile Framework™ (SAFe™) program planning methodology that brings together various teams in scheduled, cadence-based events in order to align to a shared vision, features, and a project roadmap culminating into a plan. According to Easy Agile, “SAFe™ is a series of guidelines and practices designed to help bring agility into larger organizations, across all teams and levels of the business. The framework is geared towards improving visibility, alignment, and collaboration and should lead to greater productivity, better results, and faster delivery” (2021). Traditionally, PI Planning  is conducted in-person and serves as “the heartbeat” of the Agile Release Train (ART), by including the team of people (expertise) needed to implement, test, deploy, release, and deliver a solution. This team is typically comprised of 50-125 people who plan, commit, develop, and deploy work together towards a common set of objectives. In the following pages, we provide an easy to read, adaptable toolkit that enables participants to rapidly plan and deploy PI Planning activities.

## Stakeholders and Role Assignments

Stakeholders are critical to PI Planning and may include the Business Owner, Product Owner, Product Management,  System Architect/Engineer, and Agile (Scrum) Team.  Stakeholders actively engage in PI Planning Preparation and collaborate effectively to align product development activities to business goals.  Overlap among roles may exist and depending on the organizational structure, multiple stakeholders may share one role.

Roles in PI Planning include:

- **The Integrated Health Practice Management Board (IHPMB) is the Business Owner** and serve as governance and have responsibility for the return on investment for solutions created by the ART. They have authority to adjust the relative priorities of items in the ART backlog.
- **Program Office Representatives are the Product Managers who participate in all aspects of PI Planning.**  Prior to PI Planning, Product Managers collaborate with other ART representatives to discuss and define inputs, objectives, and milestones for PI Planning events.  During PI planning, the Product Manager is responsible for “presenting the vision, roadmap, and the program backlog’s highest priority features.” After the PI Planning event, Product Managers reconvene with ART representatives to capture the outcomes/ lessons learned and summarize specific findings into PI Objectives.” (AHA.io, 2021) 
- **The XXXX are the Product Owners** and are a Agile Team level _proxy for the customer_ that prioritizes and maintains the Team Backlog, articulate the customer's needs, assists the Team with drafting Program Increment objectives and defines User Stories.  Product Owners evaluate progress, communicate status to stakeholders, and participates in the Team Confidence Vote.
- **Scrum Masters are appointed and trained to support each team.** Scrum Masters will facilitate PI Planning by facilitators leveraging multiple roles, such as managing and leading all PI processes, preparation for events (including PI Planning), finalizing Team PI objectives, and assisting the Team in estimating their capacity for Iterations.  During PI Planning, Scrum Masters assume the following roles:
    - Managing the daily PI agenda.
    - Coordinating logistics to support each day.
    - Addressing barriers and dependencies identified during team breakout sessions.
- **The Integrated Health Practice Director is the Release Train Engineer (RTE).** The RTE leads the Agile Release Train and oversees Scrum Masters in the ART. The RTE is the focal point of the PI Planning process:
    - Establishes event calendar.
    - Oversees meeting preparation.
    - Manages risks and dependencies.
    - Develops and coordinates Program PI Objectives, and Team PI Objectives.
    - Tracks progress towards goals.
    - Oversees strategy and execution alignment.
    - Faciliate system demos.
    - Facilitate Management Reviews and other Retrospectives meetings for continuous improvement.

## Logistics and Communications Plan and Checklist

The following plan outlines the steps necessary to communicate, coordinate and execute a virtual planning event. The venue for virtual planning is Microsoft Teams and the system for tracking Agile Team progress is ZenHub. The members of the planning team are the Release Train Engineer and the Lean Change Management Team (LCMT). PI Planning events normally occur every fiscal quarter. However, the IHPMB can direct a PI Planning event at any time due to emergent events (such as a pandemic). Planning lead time for a PI Planning Event is normally 4 to 6 weeks. Below is a list of communication and plan activities:
  - Determine scope and duration of event.
  - Establish Product Owner points of contact.
  - Finalize roles, presenters and attendee list and send invitations (6 weeks prior).
  - Finalize activities, breakout team rosters and daily agendas and brief IHPMB (5 weeks prior).
  - Confirm activities and Mural Canvas (5 weeks prior).
  - Integrate business owner feedback into agenda and event planning (4 weeks prior).
  - Finalize running order/slide deck (4 weeks prior).
  - Assign homework and read-ahead materials (2 weeks prior).
  - Conduct walkthrough and finalize agenda (2 weeks prior).
  - Conduct a dry run with presenters (1 week prior).

## Agenda Development

PI Planning will use a Top-Agenda to organize daily events and breakout agendas to manage breakout sessions. While needs and size of the organization can dictate the tempo and length of a PI planning event, 2-days as a minimum are recommended. 

### Day 1 Top-Agenda Activities

1. **Establish Business Context** - The CIDMO Director describes the current state of CIDMO, shares the porfolio vision of the IHPMB, and describes how effectively existing solutions are addressing current customer needs.
2. **Present the Top 10** - The Program Offices with needs in the product backlog will present the top 10 items in the backlog and express any clinical value stream milestones that need to be supported.
