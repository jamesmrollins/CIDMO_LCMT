<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 3</span> We Are Fundamentally Changing the Way Work Is Performed</h1>
<p>Today, teams are organized through a non-standardized request process that allocates an employee’s time as a percentage of full time employment (% FTE). In effect, a person may be on muliple project teams, with unrelated purposes which requires significant amounts of time to coordinate. One main benefit of the Lean Agile transformation is to provide employees with a one-at-a-time task focus. While one might think that would slow down the amount of work being completed, it actually improves workflow velocity and shortens delivery time, since it reduces wasteful coordination, scheduling and planning tasks and provides more time for actual value-added work to be performed.</p>

<div id="setup-a-development-value-stream" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Setup a Development Value Stream</h2>
<p>The instructions below outline a step-by-step method for defining your work using a Value Stream Map. Processes are ultimately defined by the flow of materials and information across your team’s organization. It helps us learn-to-see how our work is performed and what obstacles inhibit our performance. Informatics specialists, programmers, human factors engineers, coding specialists, data scientists, technical writers are who typically works in a development value stream and are responsible for its performance. Do not confuse a value stream with a workflow or other process diagram. While a Value Stream does have steps like a process, it is meant to span end-to-end and across functions to help participants see contributions by them and others and provide clarity for improvement activities. Below are some other benefits of mapping your Value Stream.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhances Systems Thinking</strong>. System thinking is looking at a complex activity and breaking it down into components and highlighting the relationships between those components. For various reasons, people often hold mental models in their heads that represent their understanding of the complex system but rarely are two mental models alike. Value stream mapping provides a holistic view of various activities the team must perform and the relationships with each other needed to produce a product.</li>
<li><strong>Visual Unification Tool</strong>. A Value Stream map is a graphical illustration of a system, created by a teammates across functions. It helps participants to see and understand the end-to-end process. Value Stream Maps help to combine each participants individual mental model of the system into a unified view.</li>
<li><strong>Simplification Tool.</strong> Often relationships between activities across several functions and their commumications via information systems are very complex. Value Stream Maps provide a means to distill complexity into its essential elements and measurements.</li>
<li><strong>Practical Means to Drive Continuous Improvement</strong>. As stated earlier, the Value Stream Map is a strategic tool, used by teams to understand where obstacles to their performance may exsist and to prioritize improvement activities. The Value Stream Map is a constantly evolving document that reflects the results of improvement activities. During Program Increment Planning, improvement activities are prioritized along with customer related tasks.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="step-1---develop-a-value-stream-canvas" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Step 1 - Develop a Value Stream Canvas</h2>
<p>This section describes how the team will describe the value stream and how it is measured. A value stream can be expressed in layers, with the physical steps outlined and the supporting technical layer shown. We describe our objective value stream using a Development Value Stream Canvas. Consult the Development_Value_Stream.docx for a template to use in the development process. A Development Value Stream is a process or sequence of events that converts a use-case, hypothesis or freature request into a solution. A key understanding is that each process step is related to improving the value of the use-case, hypothesis or feature as it transits the value stream.</p>
<p>Typically, a Development Value Stream (DVS) is organized to support a given operational or clinical value stream. In some cases, organizations group these service or product development activities by compentency into “portfolios.” The Development Value Stream often incorporates competencies from these portfolios into process steps. For example, a common Human Factors Engineering competency is software user-testing. If the Development Value Stream (DVS) had a software testing step, then this competency would need to be present on the team to support that value-added step in the process.</p>
<p>Open the canvas document and use the definitions below to fill it out.</p>
<div id="supported-clinical-value-stream" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Supported Clinical Value Stream</h3>
<p>It is important to understand exactly how your work will affect the Clinical Value Stream (CVS). As stated in the Introduction to Lean chapter, value must flows from the Development value stream to the Clinical Value Stream (CVS) to be actualized. In other words, if the product or service is not used, then its value is not realized in a meaningful way. In some cases, the Clinical Value Stream (CVS) may not be articulated, in which case the <em>team would need to at least define a causal chain that links the outputs of the Development Value Stream to the affects it intends to acheive in the CVS</em>. While objectively, we would like to look at the target facility or activity’s Value Stream Map to see what performance improvement steps they are targeting. However, in the event there is no Value Stream Map available, the team may have to determine effects of its value proposition by identifying the customer’s critical success factors, key performance indicators, leading indictors and lagging indicators. Consult the Value_Stream_Playbook.docx for more information on setting up a balanced scorecard.</p>
</div>
<div id="value-proposition" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.2</span> Value Proposition</h3>
<p>The Value Proposition describes the purpose of the DVS and for whom the proposition serves. The Value Proposition has a full description of the product or service, how it benefits the customer (from the customer’s point of view) and how it is different and better than products like it. The latter may not be identifiable as many of our products or services do not have competitors.</p>
</div>
<div id="solutions" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.3</span> Solutions</h3>
<p>Based on the competencies available in the DVS and the needs of the CVS, this DVS produces a solution in the form of a product or service. List these here.</p>
</div>
<div id="solution-context" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.4</span> Solution Context</h3>
<p>Solutions normally operate within a given context. For example, a notes template in terms of coding, sequence and presentation may change considerably between an in-person visit and a telehealth visit. The context for which your DV provides value is important to identify for both you and your customers.</p>
</div>
<div id="people-and-locations-on-the-team" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.5</span> People and Locations on the Team</h3>
<p>This is a roster of individuals who are on the team and where they are physically located. Location is important, especially in digitally enabled cross-timezone operations. Sometimes, teams expand the roster to include skill details people bring to the team.</p>
</div>
<div id="customer-segments" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.6</span> Customer Segments</h3>
<p>A Customer Segment is a logical grouping of activities for which your Value Proposition is targeted. It is important to understand who your customers are, since you may need to develop Channels to reach them. Below is a list of example segment types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solution appeals system wide (such as a nationally implemented COVID-19 vaccination template).</li>
<li>Solution appeals to only a narrow part of the system, such as an individual facility or clinic.</li>
<li>Solution appeals to a facility of a certain size or servicing a certain population of Veterans.</li>
<li>Solution supports individual or mulitple platforms such as Cerner and CPRS.</li>
<li>Solution supports diversified needs such as in-person clinics and telehealth.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="channels" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.7</span> Channels</h3>
<p>A Channel is a means the team will use to move the product or service from your team’s DVS to your customer. Customer channels are extremely important and often a missing piece of a successful implementation. Implementation fails because there is no customer who is signed up to recieve the new innovation or improvement, and no means identified to mature the product once it is in place. Today, there are likely informaticists in the organization who have longstanding relationships with facility and clinic leaders. These are useful for enlisting the help of field volunteers to provide study participants or end user testing. Doubtless, these are valuable relationships but they differ immensely from a more formal development Channel. Below are charcteristics of a solid partner channel.</p>
<ul>
<li>The channel partnership is habitual.</li>
<li>Channel partners participate in demos and other related tests.</li>
<li>They provide useful feedback.</li>
<li>They habitually provide early adoption of solutions.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="customer-relationships" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.8</span> Customer Relationships</h3>
<p>Customer Relationships are what support Channels. There are a variety of expectations a customer may require to maintain the channel.</p>
<ul>
<li>One-on-one support.</li>
<li>Training.</li>
<li>Mass communications and updates.</li>
<li>Community of practices and other forums for discussion and support.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="budget" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.9</span> Budget</h3>
<p>This section is yet to be published, as budgeting and finance needs to be rationalized with our program portfolio and integrated into our Agile framework.</p>
</div>
<div id="key-performance-indicators-kpi" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.2.10</span> Key Performance Indicators (KPI)</h3>
<p>The key performance indicators for the team are value, flow, quality, and happiness. <em>All teams are responsible for improving the outcomes of their DVS.</em> More on that later.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Value</strong> is the affect acheived by a given product or service delivered to a CVS. The value statement is related to the customer’s Critical Success Factors outlined in the feature request, and the associated leading and lagging indicators that would indicate that success.</li>
<li><strong>Flow</strong> is the rate of output the team is able to achieve with minimal waste. Flow is measured in total lead time, process step time, and flow load.
<ul>
<li><em>Total Lead Time</em> is the median amount of time it takes for a feature to transit your DVS.</li>
<li><em>Process Step Time</em> is the median amount of time it take for a feature to transit a process step in your DVS. The total of these should equal the Total Lead Time.</li>
<li><em>Flow Load</em> is the median number of features the DVS can hold at any given time.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Quality</strong> is measured by how well the product or service meets criteria of fit, form and function agreed to by the Product Owner. Often, quality is measured by the amount of rework or “bugs” that a team must prioritize into their daily workflows.</li>
<li><strong>Happiness</strong> is what is sounds like. How happy is the team? It is theorized that if a person is working at the “top of license,” then they will be happier than if working through the drudgery of endless coordination and other busy work that gets in the way of actual production. Happiness can be measured by using questionnaires periodically to assess the team’s attitudes and emotions towards their work.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="step-2---develop-a-current-state-map" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Step 2 - Develop a Current State Map</h2>
<p>Not that the Agile Team has completed their DVS Canvas, they should understand a great deal more about their customer base and how they deliver their products. They should have at least a rough idea of the affect their products or services can have on the CVS. Now they are ready to develop their own Value Stream Map and its measurables. Value Stream Mapping exercises are typically done in a classroom or conference room environment with all stakeholders present. However, with distributed adminstrative environments, Teams and Zoom are teleconferencing services that are rapidly replacing the in-person meeting. Internet challenges notwithstanding, it is possible to conduct a Value Stream Mapping exercise as described below using a teams channel, with a shared Whiteboard, Lucid or Word Doc for team members to participate. Consult Setup_a_value_stream_workshop.docx for detailed instructions on how to set up a Teams channel with a shared Whiteboard.</p>
<div id="conduct-a-first-walk" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1</span> Conduct a First-Walk</h3>
<p>Since most CIDMO process steps are not tangible, its not like we can walk through a factory and actually witness the work being performed on the shop floor. With our digitally enabled and distributed teams, we use the term “walk” as a metaphore for stepping through the basic value added steps in our objective process for the first time. In some respects, we may need <strong>time to deliberate</strong> when forming the team to define these steps for the first time. Typically, it is best to start with the big picture. Answers to many of these questions have already been answered in the Development Value Stream Canvas. Quickly review them here.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the story of our product?</li>
<li>Who does it serve?</li>
<li>How does it serve them?</li>
<li>What are the major steps used to make the product or perform the service?</li>
<li>How does it get to them?</li>
<li>Once the product or service is delivered, how does the customer need to be supported?</li>
<li>What measurements are associated with each step (process time, percent correct and acceptable)?</li>
</ul>
<div id="layout-the-value-stream-map" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1.1</span> Layout the Value Stream Map</h4>
<p>After the team completes the discussion above, the team returns to the task of developing its first Value Stream Map. We will use Microsoft Whiteboard in a Teams channel to develop the working copy of the map. The Whiteboard is accessible simultaneously by all members of the team. The Whiteboard has PostIt notes that can be used to describe each process block. Process flows from left to right.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Remember that we are looking at most basic information at the macro level.</strong> Although there may be many sub-steps required to complete a process step, we are not focusing on &gt;these. This is what differentiates a value stream map from a workflow. A workflow would include all work steps to complete a given task, whereas the Value Stream would focus on &gt;the macro steps needed to transform the product to meet the customer need. Value Stream maps are strategic in nature and will be used for focusing on improvement activities &gt;over a long period of time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The graphic below illustrates the major features of a Value Stream Map. The map starts with a customer request or requirements, identifies the major value-added steps that transforms the request into a delivered product or service. If needed, a Value Stream can have branches to represent a certain percentage of effort that might take on a slight variation.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.2</span> Conduct a Second-Walk</h3>
<p>During the First-Walk, we identified the major activites and functions sequentially involved in delivering a product or service. During the Second-Walk we will focus on the performance of the value stream and the obstacles to flow. In order to prioritize any inprovements to the Value Stream, it is important to assess its performance in terms of value, flow and quality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>In lieu of actual measurements, educated guesses will suffice to get started.</strong> If you are organizing an Agile Team and documenting a Development Value Stream for the first
time, many of these measurements may not be available. See the chapter on GitHub and ZenHub for more information about passive collection of team performance information.
GitHub and ZenHub provide repository storage capacity, document version control, code-base control and kanban work management support; while passively gathering data for the
team to self-regulate its performance and set priorities to meet objectives.</p>

<div id="define-process-time-pt-for-each-process-block" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.3.2.1</span> Define Process Time (PT) for Each Process Block</h4>
<p>The amount of time to complete the transformation described by the process step is called the Process Time (PT). It is nomrally measured in terms of minutes, hours, days, or in some cases weeks. Standardize the unit of measure for time throughout the Value Stream. Process time <em>does not</em> include any time the product or service spends waiting. It is determined as if the workers can work on the process step uninterrupted. Time studies are not required for this step; just need to know more or less how long it takes to finish the work. As improvement activites are directed to this step, more detailed analysis can be performed to highlight areas of improvement.</p>

<div id="value-added-versus-non-value-added-process-time-vauva" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.3.2.2</span> Value-added versus Non-value Added Process Time (VA/UVA)</h4>
<p>Value-added activity is what your customer is willing to pay for. Non-value Added Activites fall into two categories - Unavoidable Non-Value Added activity and Avoidable Non-value Added activity. Unavoidable Non-value Added activity is an activity that must be performed, such as a policy decision that requires a certain form be filled out before the Value Added step is performed. An Avoidable Non-valuye Added activity is an activity that can be, and should be, immediately removed because it is within the teams control. The distinction between these types of activities are key to understanding wasteful practices and how to remove them. Using your customer’s perspective, evaluate each process step for its Value-Added and Non-value Added content. Lable the step “VA” or “UVA” for Value Added or Unavoidable Non-value Added.</p>

<div id="define-process-lead-time-lt" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.3.2.3</span> Define Process Lead Time (LT)</h4>
<p>Lead Time is the amount of time it takes for the work from the previous steps to present at the current step. It is determined by taking the sum of the previous process step Process Times. The total of all Process Times in a Value Stream is the total Lead Time or throughput time. Lead Time includes all delays and time work spends in queu waiting for the next step. Therefore, the total Lead Time calculation is not made until the Barriers to Flow in Step 3 are identified.</p>

<div id="percent-complete-and-acceptable-ca" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.3.2.4</span> Percent Complete and Acceptable (%C&amp;A)</h4>
<p>A simple quality measure is percentage of work completed in a process step that can move directly to the next step without correction or rework over the total work performed in that process. The higher the percentage, the higher the rate of completion and acceptance in the eyes of downstream process steps, or the end customer. Because a shortcomings in a process step may not be discovered until further down in a Value Stream, it is important to identify the source of %C&amp;A hits.</p>
